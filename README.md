#first_play_with_three.js
Using three.js to create some animation for my website

##Why?

I wanted to have a play with three.js just for fun, so decided to create something for my website using various tutorials.

Note: According to various things have read, if want to use textures need to run the code via a server otherwise will get CORS errors, which i did experience, thus why i am using Node.js, but you can use any server.

Still in progress...
